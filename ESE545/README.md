# ESE545 Data Mining

ESE545 is a Machine Learning class which focuses on fundamental mathematics and basic algoritms. We derived every concept and algorithm step by step and implemented them using Python on several classic datasets. Since this course is more about principles behind algorithms, we are not allowed to use high level APIs like sklearn (scikit-learn).
